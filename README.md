# SW Planets App

## Goal

The goal of this project was to create an application in which a list of planets from the Star Wars universe will be displayed. The planets are displayed in a table, in which each row displays the name, diameter, climate and terrain of the planet. The table has pagination which allows the user to navigate between pages. When the user clicks on a planet's name he or she is redirected to a page with details of the selected planet. The details displayed on the planet's page are: name, diameter, climate, terrain, gravity, population, orbital period, and number and names of all residents of that planet.

## Technologies

Libraries used in the project: **React, React Router, MaterialUI, styled-components, Axios**
